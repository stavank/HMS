<h2>Hospital Management System</h2>

This project is built in Flask (Python Framework) and SQLAlchemy(SQL ORM in Python) as its backend. 
Bootstrap is used for the awesome front end looks.

The purpose of the project was to get hands on experience with the before mentioned set of technologies.

This system currently provides interfaces to 
<ul>
<li>add new users to the system.</li>
<li>grant / revoke roles to users</li>
<li>give various permissions (read / write) to roles</li>
<li>add / remove patients</li>
<li>add / remove tests</li>
<li>search patients data</li>
<li>search tests data</li>
</ul>

I am working on setting up new interfaces to 
<ul>
<li>create / manage appointments</li>
<li>create / manage bills</li>
</ul>

The requiremets for this project are mentioned in the <b>requirements.txt</b> file.
<b>pip</b> will be a good manager for all these required softwares.
Also there is a setup guide in the docs folder. The instrutions mentioned are for a <b>Windows</b> system.
But all these steps should be mostly similar for a Linux system too.
